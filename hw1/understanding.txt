1) took responses of the image at alpha random points for the filters 
2) used k means to club same responses together into same cluster to create dictionary 
3) Find visual words ==> represent the images using the words in the dictionary
4) Save histograms of the visual words in training set 
5) For an incoming image, make its histogram and compare it to all the other histograms and use some technique like knn for histogram matching
